  # Classifying a geom by a non existant key in the data frame now works.

  # to the key given. We could extend this to even support numerical values,
  # but then we have to change the `col` field of the `Scale` to be a `Value`.
  # For more complicated things, mutating the data frame beforehand is certainly
  # advisable though.
  # NOTE: This currently still only works for `geom_point`, since we simply
  # have not implemented `aes` arguments to the other geoms. That's an easy
  # change though.
  # NOTE2: currently broken again, due to change in how `geom_point` gets data
  # But, once solved will also work for other geoms!
