* v0.2.14

- starts a changelog :)
- =formula.evaluate[T](node: FormulaNode, data: T): Value= is now
  =formula.reduce(node: FormulaNode, data: DataFrame): Value=. Generic usage
  is just clutter. =reduce= makes the intent clearer and opens up the
  name for an =evaluate= that returns a full vector
- adds =formula.evaluate(node: FormulaNode, data: DataFrame):
  PersistentVector[Value]=. 
- The =Scale.col= field is now =FormulaNode= instead of =string=. This
  allows for calculations on the DF to use for scales instead of only
  columns. 
- =aes()= is now generic and takes a mix of =string | FormulaNode= to
  allow to apply formulas to the DF w/o intermediate calculations on
  the DF manually. E.g. =aes(y = f{"yCol" * 2})= is now valid
- improve performance for certain plots with many geoms
- add inplace variants for =select=, =mutate=, =transmute=
  (=*Inplace=).
