* v0.2.20
- move =font= helper to =ggplot_utils=
- remove spacing between multiple legends. Previously there was 1 cm
  of space if multiple legends were shown. That took too much space
  and wasn't required imo.
- fix classification by multiple discrete scales
- fix issue for discrete scales, which caused index error in
  =getView=, when a position was moved via =binPosition=
- add =width=, =height= to scales, which are collected. This was
  simply missing.
- add =geom_text=
- add =font= field to =GgStyle= object
- update =rMultipleLegends= due to spacing between two legends
- add recipes:
  - =rSimpleGeomText.nim=
  - =rClassifiedGeomText.nim=
  - =rAnnotateUsingGeomText.nim=
  - =rAnnotateMaxValues.nim=

* v0.2.19
Hotfix release for small regressions introduced in =v0.2.18=
- fixes the layout of plots discrete axes. Due to recent ginger changes
  the position of the ticks and tick labels was wrong.
- fixes the placement of =geom_tile= for discrete cases.
- updates all plots with discrete axes

* v0.2.18
- finally fixes multiple legends. Now automatically evenly spaced and centered
- distances of legends / labels to legend are now fixed in absolute
  units (thanks to fix in ginger =v0.1.15=)
- fix distance of tick labels to ticks, now also in fixed absolute
  distances (that's why every plot is updated)
- add =geom_tile=
- update *all* plots due to ginger fixes / placement of tick labels

* v0.2.17
- most geoms now take an =alpha= argument to override the alpha of
  =fillColor= 
- if a fill color of a line is set, the line is now continued down to
  the x axis

* v0.2.16
- =geom_point= with =positoin = "stack"= now draw points at =y = 0= 
- =geom_histogram/bar= now draw "empty" elements for =position =
  "stack"= (set =lineWidth= to 0 to make them disappear)
- y axes may now be discrete (previously only the x axis could be
  discrete)
- rewrites drawing code to have less duplication. For some kinds of
  plots this might (!) incur a tiny performance regression.
- refactors out code related to
  - collection and filling of scales:
    [[./src/ggplotnim/collect_and_scales.nim]] 
  - postprocessing of scales:
    [[./src/ggplotnim/postprocess_scales.nim]] 
  - (most) drawing code:
    [[./src/ggplotnim/ggplot_drawing.nim]]

* v0.2.15
- *IMPORTANT*: there was a bug in =seqmath.histogram=, which is used
  in =geom_histogram= / if =stat = "bin"= is used. The bug caused
  wrong histogram calculations *if and only if* unequal bin widths
  were used. Equal bin widhts were fine. This was fixed in =seqmath=
  =v0.1.7=
- add =geom_errorbar= for plots with error bars in x / y direction
- add =geom_linerange=, which are either error bars without an
  orthogonal line at the end (not "T" shaped, "|" like) or just, well,
  line ranges.
- slight performance increase for large datasets, due to avoiding
  running over data twice to determine min / max values.

* v0.2.14

- starts a changelog :)
- =formula.evaluate[T](node: FormulaNode, data: T): Value= is now
  =formula.reduce(node: FormulaNode, data: DataFrame): Value=. Generic usage
  is just clutter. =reduce= makes the intent clearer and opens up the
  name for an =evaluate= that returns a full vector
- adds =formula.evaluate(node: FormulaNode, data: DataFrame):
  PersistentVector[Value]=. 
- The =Scale.col= field is now =FormulaNode= instead of =string=. This
  allows for calculations on the DF to use for scales instead of only
  columns. 
- =aes()= is now generic and takes a mix of =string | FormulaNode= to
  allow to apply formulas to the DF w/o intermediate calculations on
  the DF manually. E.g. =aes(y = f{"yCol" * 2})= is now valid
- improve performance for certain plots with many geoms
- add inplace variants for =select=, =mutate=, =transmute=
  (=*Inplace=).
